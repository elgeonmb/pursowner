Each state's onenter defines how to process containers it might recieve from any predecessor state (as defined in the state diagram)

Each state's onexit defines how to package containers for any possible successor state

The state machine ensures that each state knows what the proceeding and following states will be and handles the actual passing of information and transfer of game control between states.
